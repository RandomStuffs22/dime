# Dime: eCommerce, made simple
http://dime.im / @dimecms / @codin_co

## What is Dime?
It’s a super-simple, self-hosted eCommerce system. You can upload and manage an unlimited number of products, purchases, and more — all for free.

## How do payments work?
Currently, you can only accept payments through PayPal, although we are planning on integrating more payment methods soon. (Psst, Stripe: hurry up and come to the UK so we can integrate you!)

## Will my server support Dime?
To install Dime, you’ll need at least:
* PHP 5.3.2 or newer
* MySQL 5.5.23 or newer
* Apache with mod_rewrite enabled (or equivalent)
* A PayPal account to send payments to
* Some stuff to sell
* (optionally) Ability to install files outside of the public_html (or equivalent) root

## How do I install Dime?
1. Upload all the files that came with Dime to your web server. In the interests of security, you will need to point the public_html directory name to `public` (more detailed instructions here: http://dime.im/help/public_root
2. Visit the path you just uploaded the files to, and follow the installer, which should guide you through the process.
3. Log in to the admin panel.
4. ...
5. Profit!
